# Work_Project__Meeting_Operations_Cost_Analysis

This project aimed to analyze data related to our Meeting Operations team, specifically our Support and Moderator teams. The main objective was to compare the costs of working with an external moderation team versus an internal one and determine the potential savings from transitioning to an internal team.

As a result of our analysis, we anticipate substantial cost-savings starting from the last quarter of 2023 and continuing into 2024 and beyond.
